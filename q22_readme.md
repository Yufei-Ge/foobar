Please Pass the Coded Messages

==========================

You need to pass a message to the bunny prisoners, but to avoid detection, the code you agree to use is...obscure.

You have L, a list containing some digits (0 to 9). Write a function solution(L) which finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits and is divisible by 3. If it is not possible to make such a number, **return 0** as the solution. **L will contain anywhere from 0 to 9 digits**. The same digit may appear multiple times in the list, but each in the list may only be used once.
